## Projects 🚀

These are a few of the projects that I have had the pleasure of working on.

### [UrStore](https://urstore.ca/)

UrStore is an E-commerce application having the following modules - Custom product editors, Bulk product section Affiliate marketing, Design Tools, Campaigns, and fundraisers with awesome concepts and logic regarding client business. More than 50,000 Stores are available with more than 1,00,000 designs and with custom artwork of over 1000 products.


### Ugoflip

The project is based on a lottery ticket game, wherein the user can purchase lottery tickets using cryptocurrencies like Gama, BTC, ETH, and the winner is picked randomly by the system and everyone has an equal chance to be a homeowner and make lots of money irrespective of social status or income level. The winner can claim awards/gifts. In this system, I have used third-party APIs like Coinbase along with paystack payment gateway, run SDK, etc.

### Resume Builder

On this resume, builder users can edit job application templates. The data the user types into the job application is saved ONLY in client-side files and also generates AI content using OpenAi. No requests (with editable user data) to the server are made – only if the user wants to generate a pdf.
